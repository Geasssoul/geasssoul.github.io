  <p class="about-background">
    Hello! I'm a dedicated and passionate Landscape Architect, holding a Bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture. 
    My professional journey across China and New Zealand has enriched me with a diverse array of challenges, shaping both my creative and practical abilities, enhancing my deep understanding of design skills. </p>
    <p>Currently, I am broadening my horizons by pursuing a Master of Applied Computing at Lincoln University. This venture is a testament to my commitment to continual learning, and I am trying to blend technology with the art of landscape design in the future.</p>
