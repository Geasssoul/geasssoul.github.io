<p>Clevedon is a picturesque town located south of Auckland, offering a perfect destination for family holidays and quality time together. Situated close to Duer Regional Park and Reserve, Clevedon boasts stunning scenic views and natural beauty. This project is a continuation of my previous group work, focused on developing a tourism route that enhances the overall experience for visitors to Clevedon. My part of the project is located on a mountain route with a hiking track and aims to create a memorable and enjoyable journey.</p>
